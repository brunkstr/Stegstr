First time opening Stegstr on macOS?

Right-click (or Control-click) Stegstr → Open → click Open in the dialog.
One dialog, then you can open Stegstr normally from then on.

If you already double-clicked and see a security message: go to
System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway" next to Stegstr.
